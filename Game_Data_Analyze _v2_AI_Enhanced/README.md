## 🎯 Key Capabilities

Unlike the V1 (Standard) version which focuses on *historical data* ("What happened?"), this AI-Enhanced version focuses on **prediction and segmentation** ("What will happen?").

### 1. 🤖 AI-Driven User Segmentation (Clustering)
* **Tech Stack:** K-Means Clustering (Scikit-Learn).
* **Function:** Automatically groups players into **5 distinct personas** based on behavior (e.g., playtime, spend, session frequency) rather than simple rule-based grouping.
* **AI Tagging:** Integrates an **Offline LLM Mapping** layer (`ai_persona.py`) to assign semantic, business-friendly labels to clusters:
    * 🐳 **Whales:** High spenders.
    * ⚔️ **Grinders:** High activity, low spend.
    * ⚠️ **Risk:** Low engagement patterns.

### 2. 🔮 Predictive Churn Analytics
* **Tech Stack:** Logistic Regression.
* **Function:** Calculates a real-time **Churn Probability Score (0-1)** for every active player.
* **Actionable Insight:** Identifies a "High Risk Cohort" (players likely to leave in 7 days) and visualizes the risk distribution, enabling proactive retention campaigns.

### 3. 💡 Automated Smart Insights (NLG)
* **Tech Stack:** Rule-Based Natural Language Generation.
* **Function:** Simulates an AI analyst by dynamically generating text summaries based on the filtered dataset. It provides instant context on engagement and monetization health without API latency.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

This project adopts a **"Hybrid AI Architecture"** optimized for production performance and data privacy:

* **Pre-computation Pipeline (`data_loader.py`):** ML models (Clustering & Prediction) run immediately upon data loading. This ensures that filtering and interaction are instantaneous (0ms latency).
* **Offline Inference:** Instead of calling external LLM APIs (like GPT-4) in real-time, logic is encapsulated locally. This ensures:
    * 🔒 **GDPR Compliance:** No user data leaves the local environment.
    * ⚡ **Performance:** No network latency.
    * 💰 **Cost Efficiency:** Zero API operational costs.
